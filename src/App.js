/*we can define onClick event on button but the author prefere to use onSubmit ont the form, view note1. By using onSubmit, we can

/**Every React event function receives an event argument, and for React events this argument is just a wrapper around the native JS event 
 * object. All the methods available in the native event object are also available here. For example, since we want to take over the HTML submit
 * logic we should prevent the default form submission behavior here using event.preventDefault(); (see note 2)
 * To read the value that user tyes in this inbox we can simply use de DOM API. We can give the input here an ID attribute and use
 * getElementById to read its value. React has a special property named ref that we can use to get a reference to this element ( ref={} ) 
 * this is kind of fancy ID that React keeps in-memory and associates with every rendered element. 
 * To use ref we need to instanciate an object (*** note 4) we can name it anything we like, we named here userNameInput, and we do a
 * React.createRef call in there, and to use this ref, that is part of this instance now we can use ref={this.userNameInput}
 *  Inside the handleSubmit the value is this.userNameInput.current.value

/** React has another method to work with input element which is to control their values directly and it has through React itself, Rather than
 * reading it from the DOM elements, this method is often labeled as controlled components, and it has some more advantages over the simple ref
 * property. We introduce state object,and in this object we define an element the input value of the userName filed ( **6) and we initialize it as 
 * an empty string, then we use this new state element as the value of the input element. ( value = {this.state.userName}) and his immediately
 * creates a controlled element. Now we are controlling the value of the input. 
 * However you cant really type in this input field anymore because React is now controlling the value, this is way we need onChange event so that
 * the DOM can tell  React that something has changed in this input and you shoul reflected in the UI as well.
 * Basically, on Change event happened on every character that we typed here,and it made React aware of this element state change and
 * and React reflected the change back to the element itself because it's a regular React state change. This method is valuable if you need to provide some kind of
 * feedback for the user as the user typing. One example of that woul be a password strength indicator or the count of character as the user
 * is typing as an Twitter Tweet's form, because the whole state is in React, we can add a UI description as well. And we don't need to read the value from the DOM,
 * it's in React's memory.
